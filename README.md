PersonaDB is a database, privately controlled by each legal entity (user, organisation, service) in eventually consistent system. It is intended as a "universal database" to lower the "barrier of entry" and popularise your unique "Value-Add" - custom built to be part of KhaiPhong cryptographic and streaming systems - where you can ride on proven accumulated efforts from others and custom change only what required that we track on its branches of goleveldb, prometheus, go-git, cloudevents, (kafka-go, openfaas, saga, cardano) if different from the cited open sources.

Embedded "Serverless Function / FaaS" in cloudevents is an implementation of Composable Event Processors while data ownership of the legal entity is enforced as a part of the user's PersonaAI. The database is connected to evolving systems - OmHub where each public kafka topic has its own database if economically justified - at ThankYou clubs (public topics filtered by places, local Machine Learnings and Smart Contracts where digital money has strong guarantees of fraud-free commerce) to guarantee about timestamps and immutability of ordering facts and events via proof of stakes in Settlement Layer.

Eventually consistent system is relevant to current behavioral economics, or a method of economic analysis that applies psychological insights into human behavior to explain economic decision-making. It is applicable to global Internet, and even so with Normative Value of the values viewed from the dimension of people to change both current conflicts on PrajnaPlace and the community Conscience level of Right and Wrong in a sense of Justice as illustrated in this site logo. Playing the role of a "universal database", PersonaDB can bring together two other factors - (1) transparent statistics orthogonal to the three pillars of powers in modern democratic society (such as in Canada), and (2) accumulated macro economics derived from both time-series in capitalism and input-output of snap-shot structural changes in planned economies - in management of modern economies. The mathematical proof in the existence of an inverse matrix for a snap-shot consistency between economic time-series and input-output tables is important in a right statistical measurement system used in 1000+ simultaneous equations for model forcastings and simulations. We do have unique experience and can help in this important field.

By selecting the location of data-pipeline OmHub, you are subjected only to the governing laws that the system must conform in balancing between individual and state rights where Invisible Market Values according to natural laws such as Empathy and Economics operate. You can have your own private OmHub located at your data centre to be completely under your control.
