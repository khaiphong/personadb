PersonaDB is a value-added three (<a href="https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger" target="_blank">Badger</a>, <a href="https://github.com/prometheus" target="_blank">Prometheus time series</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/" target="_blank">KhaiPhong Git</a>) in one database, <b>privately controlled by each legal entity</b> (user, organisation, service, topic) with strong consistency locally to assure proof of settlement, in an eventually consistent <b>distributed system (Mu, MuHub, OmHub)</b> globally for multi-party proof of settlement plus value-added Artificial Intelligence (AI) in <a href="https://github.com/dgraph-io/" target="_blank">Graph database</a>. It is intended as a "<b>free database having cost-effective professional development-maintenance-support to equalize the playing fields of grassroot <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/agent-of-changes.html#Section_3.5" target="_blank">breakthroughs</a> whose securities are tied back to Linux kernel features of cgroups and namespaces</b>" to lower the "barrier of entry" and popularise your unique "<b>Value-Add</b>" - custom built to be part of <b>KhaiPhong cryptographic and streaming systems</b> - where you can ride on proven accumulated efforts from others, and securely change and/or allow services to change what required on key-value storage, monitoring system, git, event (linked to kafka, openfaas, saga, cardano).

Embedded "<b>Serverless Function / FaaS</b>" in cloudevents - as result of PersonaAI Normative-Positive Intelligence from Om Central Nervous System to change the course of the event processes - is an implementation of <b>Composable Event Processors</b> while data ownership of the legal entity is enforced as a part of the user's <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/personaai/" target="_blank">PersonaAI</a> through Shen-Hsiu <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/right-mindfulness.html" target="_blank">KP Body&amp;Mind</a> cleaning (implementations) of Bodhidharma Detachment-Prajna, Xuan-Zang Consciousness of the Consciousness, and HuiNeng Wu-Nien, Dhyana-Samadhi, Samadhi-Prajna in <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/eip/" target="_blank">EIP custom implementation of Gotama's First Discourse</a>. This is the first time significant value-added consciousness technologies are <b>integrated and statistically tested</b> due to available people actually knowing and spreading their know-how in reverse-engineering to look for optimal and cultivable conditions leading to different depths of  "[ <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/right-mindfulness.html#Section_1" target="_blank">Wu-Nien / Blank Mind / Vô Niệm / Mindfulness<a> ]. The distributed database is connected to evolving systems - OmHub where each public kafka topic has its own database - at <b>GSLP/ThankYou clubs</b> (public topics filtered by places, local Machine Learnings and Smart Contracts where digital money has strong guarantees of fraud-free commerce) to guarantee about timestamps and immutability of ordering facts and events via proof of stakes where legally involved parties have the right to extract (or use a service to extract) relevant data they legitimately own for their <b>PersonaAI</b>. OmHub is a <b>distributed local data centre</b> where activities and relationships of local participants take place.

Eventually consistent system is relevant to current <b>behavioral economics</b>, or a method of economic analysis that applies psychological insights into human behavior to explain economic decision-making. It is relevant to Internet of instantaneously huge data in the <b>Dependent Nature</b> commonly known as "butterfly effect", and even more so with <b>Normative Value of the values</b> viewed from the dimension of people to change current conflicts on the duality plane into <b>PrajnaPlace<sup>&#169;&#174;</sup></b> for better Present Living and many generations to come as illustrated in this <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong" target="_blank">logo</a>.

Playing the role of a "<b>universal database</b>" - due to cost effective and readily availlable features - in possible <b>Open Government Data</b> where all stakeholders are parts to ride on the mass innovations in <b>Making Life Easier and Happier</b>, custom PersonaDB with extra (GoLang) packages can bring together three other factors to properly manage the complexities of modern economies where each independent nation has its own state rights in influencing the world affairs: (1) transparent Statistics orthogonal to the <b>three independent pillars of democracy</b> (Legislature, Executive, Judiciary such as in Canada) to avoid GIGO (Garbage In Garbage Out) in facilitating fluid interactions for the persona Insghts and measurable modern technologies in a delicate balance of "<b>Making Life Easier and Happier</b>", (2) accumulated <b>consistent macro economics</b> derived from both time-series in capitalism and input-output of snap-shot structural changes in planned economies for <b>visible insights and differences between causations and correlations</b>, and (3) new behavioral economics coming from AI "<b>Deep Learning</b>" to open a new dimension where cultivable quality of one's consciousness direct all activities and relationships to <b>change oneself and the environment one a part</b> where people are centres of all activities and relationships.

The mathematical proof in the existence of an inverse matrix for a <b>snap-shot consistency</b> between economic time-series and input-output tables is important in a right statistical measurement system (such as <b>Statistics Canada</b>) used in many 1000+ simultaneous equations for forcastings and simulations of <b>National Policies</b> (used by Economic Council of Canada). We also proved - based on Alberta IDEAL (Industrial Disaggregated Economic Activity Long term) model - that the system can be implemented at regional level where monetary policy is given at National level to study the <b>impact of mega projects</b> to the local and national economies. Known mathematical proofs and their identified checked points in the processes of data collections - "<b>seamlessly massaging and transforming</b>" - are internally enforced to assure the qualities and appropriateness of reported statistical data to be consistent with proven international standards and <b>relevant industrial classifications</b>.  Quality data together with proven technologies are important in modern complex world where <b>AI can be parts of Strategic Intelligence</b>, capable to see Thing-As-It-Is and one's strategic position to push the event toward What Count far beyond the bullying techniques in trade negotiations, threatening and/or back-door politics of the Grasper and the Grasped<sup><a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/references.html#R8" target="_blank">[R8]</a></sup>.

With PersonaDB and available computing power, compiled statistics for input-output tables can be easily and consistent with the time-series to overcome the past issues of <b>outdated structural changes</b> to render both Canadian CANDIDE model and Alberta IDEAL model cost prohibited. Combining both time-series and input-output tables, we can have a scientific model for forecastings and simulations based on <b>solid understandings of causes and effects in accumulated "Deep Learning"</b> from proven economic theories and mass Consciousness which is a <b>Fresh Start</b> for all countries, including Canada that we can bring something very unique - such as discovered No-Conflict Consciousness - to <b>Canadian strategies of AI, Public Policies, and Responsible Investments</b>, measurable and auditable via Management, Statistics and Economics.

That "<b>something very unique</b>" is the scientific implementation of Gotama's first discourse / Dhammacakkappavattana in turning the Dharma Wheel<sup><a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/references.html#D20" target="_blank">[D20]</a></sup>, and minimizing <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/agent-of-changes.html#Section_3.5" target="_blank">possible conflicts</a> in all activities and relationships. It is the Machine Learning (ML) of important variables for more understanding of relevant forces and attributes in <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/eip/" target="_blank">Executive Information Portal (EIP)</a> via Persona Custom Feed and its interaction with "<b>Persona Stream of Awareness</b>" of each legal entity, an AI tool for cultivating [ <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/a-light-out-of-darkness.html#Section_1.2" target="_blank">Human Harmony / Nhân Hòa</a> ] to naturally make happened Canadian Vision of "<a href="https://international.gc.ca/world-monde/issues_development-enjeux_developpement/human_rights-droits_homme/inclusion_respect.aspx?lang=eng" target="_blank">Inclusive Society</a>". The system provides <b>better forcastings and simulations in major international projects and negotiations</b>. Modelings and simulations are mechanical processes to assist deeper understanding of complex issues on the duality plane of conflicting events.

From the event Truth Plane as illustrated on this <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong" target="_blank">site logo</a> - perpendicular to the plane of conflicting consciousness - one may have the sixth and/or seventh senses to instinctively see (based on cultivable and measurable Normative Intelligence) a <b>breakthrough and one's strategic position</b> to move the event toward What Count, widening the custom tool of <b>Deep Learning</b> from layered Neural Networks. We assert "<b>widening the tool of Deep Learning</b>" since (1) what AI scientists call layered Neural Networks are <b>statistically deducted training layers</b> on the duality plane of conflicting consciousness deriving from huge data processing in all aspects of present living which is one step better than <b>Greed and Fear from all isms up to 2019</b> at both mental and physical "<b>inflicting pains</b>" of the zero-sum game from the Grasper and the Grasped<sup><a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/references.html#R8" target="_blank">[R8]</a></sup>; (2) it is different from <b>layered No-Confict Consciousness for [ 1 + 1 &gt;&gt; 2 ]</b> via Pareto principle 20/80 rule discovered in (2.1) Gotama's Mindfulness-Prajna, (2.2) Jesus's Kingdom of God from within, (2.3) Bodhidharma's Detachment-Prajna, (2.4) HuiNeng's Dhyana-Samadhi / Samadhi-Prajna, (2.5) XuanZang's Consciousness of the consciousness, (2.6) Soyen's "God not in the world is the false God and the World not in God is unreality", and (2.7) KhaiPhong's Compassion-Prajna which are all measurable via the manifestations in the <b>Right Effort</b> of Then What? This kind of "<b>instinct from the sixth and seventh sense</b>" known and proven by <b>HuiNeng's Dhyana-Samadhi and Samadhi-Prajna</b> can be further tested from top-down, bottom-up, inside-out, and outside-in via custom <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/eip" target="_blank">Executive Information Portal (EIP)</a> to strategically play in National Securities and International Conflicts such as current Issues in [ <b>South China Sea / Vietnamese East Sea / Philippines West Sea</b> ].

Moving toward the same direction, the inventor of the World Wide Web - Sir Tim Berners-Lee - launched a manifesto for a new, fairer internet named "<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90243936/exclusive-tim-berners-lee-tells-us-his-radical-new-plan-to-upend-the-world-wide-web" target="_blank">Solid</a>", a decentralized web platform to give users “<b>personal empowerment through data</b>” which we have done under "<a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/a-bird-view-of-who-i-am.html#Section_3.1" target="_blank">Executive Informtion Portal (EIP)</a>" for Canadian Oil &amp; Gas in 2000 - 2002, having partly supported by Canadian Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&amp;ED) from 2001 to 2012. We turn this project into <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/eip/" target="_blank">Privately Progressive EIP</a> using <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/personaai/" target="_blank">PersonaAI</a> under Free <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/mu/" target="_blank">Universal Application</a> for each legal entity, having <a href="https://medium.com/@leeb/introducing-the-graphql-foundation-3235d8186d6d" target="_blank">standard GraphQL</a> to control which services can access which parts of the user private data store.

<b>Private PersonaDB</b> enables each legal entity being both producer and consumer, having unlimited accumulated data without affecting its performance due to container-based distributed technologies. The user has <b>total access control to its own data and what it wants</b> to learn itself and <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/nature-of-things.html#Section_2.1" target="_blank">cultivable Conscious Living</a> via progressive <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/personaai/" target="_blank">PersonaAI</a> where <b>Conscience and </b><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters" target="_blank">Privacy</a> is your private domain in which you can <b>meditate, reflect, think, reason, interact/speak without unauthorized external interferences</b> from other human beings in which <b>Creativity, Exploration, and Dissent</b> reside. You can even have the <b>option to destroy the data of specified activities immediately and/or after a time elapse</b> i.e. Time-to-Live (TTL) key-value node ready for garbage collection with or without Git version-control. It is the whole life private <b>Diary of Learning and Living</b> having Machine and Deep Learning at your finger tip, plus optionally your contribution back to humanity like the Library of a US President! The <a href="https://medium.com/@leeb/introducing-the-graphql-foundation-3235d8186d6d" target="_blank">standard GraphQL</a> is a part of both personal and data-centre distributed databases to enable <b>flexible query language</b> securely poking into the central Nervous System at minimum costs. 

We think it is the Right Time to use available and coming technologies of 4.0 Industrial Revolution to <b>democratize Conscious Living</b>, driven by invisible hands of <b>Prajna</b> manifested from the community Conscience in a sense of Justice, and <b>Economics</b> in allocating scare resources according to one's Value of the values in one's <b>Continuity of the Consciousness</b>. Seeing the benefits of hand-on experiences in <b>Making Life Easier and Happier</b>, we ask you being a part of this important field based on proven accumulated experiences rather than guessed works from tainted public data and past indoctrination of all isms blah blah blah by criminals and professional scam artists, messing up their own lives and humanity due to <b>Ignorance of Greeds and Fears</b><sup><a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/references.html#R8" target="_blank">[R8]</a></sup> and possible solutions contributed by <b>dedicated explorers</b> to be Shared.

By selecting the location of data-pipeline OmHub, you are subjected only to the governing laws that the system must conform in balancing between individual and state rights where Invisible Market Values according to natural laws such as <b>cultivable and measurable Empathy and Economics</b> operate. You can have your own private OmHub located at your data centre to be completely under your control. There is no dictator system from all isms - no matter how cunning and cheating it is of the <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/references.html#R8" target="_blank">strong leader(s)</a> in destroying themselves and others - can suppress the "<b>Human Rights</b>" coming from the <b>discovered No-Conflict Consciousness</b> awaken in the mass.

In brief, KhaiPhong brings to the table (1) responsible investments and developments in Special Economic Zones, an outcome from its <b>Strategic Intelligence Service</b> to change oneself and the environments in engaged living, (2) accountable and transparent public policies via the <b>system know-how</b> in measurable Managements of relevant maturity models, Statistics and Economics, (3) clean environments with best engineering practices and most efficient technologies in [ <b>Plan &gt;&lt; Execution &gt;&lt; Feedback</b> ], plus AI "<b>Deep Learning</b>" from 4.0 Industrial Revolution in the new Era of Conscious Living, <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/right-mindfulness.html" target="_blank">accessible only from humanity upward</a> according to "<b>Natural laws in Making Life Easier and Happier</b>" that only the "light" can be floating up, and (4) cultivable and measurable <b>layered No-Conflict Consciousness</b> to enable people the driving forces of all activities and relationships.
