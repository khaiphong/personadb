It is intended as a "universal database" to lower the "barrier of entry" and democratise your unique "Value-Add" - custom built to be part of KhaiPhong cryptographic and streaming systems - where you can ride on proven accumulated efforts from others and custom change only what required that we track on its branches of goleveldb, prometheus, go-git, kafka-go, cloudevents, openfaas, and saga to be different from the cited open sources.

Embedded "Serverless Function / FaaS" in cloudevents is an implementation of Composable Event Processors. The database is connected to evolving systems - OmHub - at ThankYou clubs (local Machine Learnings and Smart Contracts where digital money has strong guarantees of fraud-free commerce) to guarantee about timestamps and immutability of ordering facts and events via proof of stakes in Settlement Layer.

By selecting the location of data-pipeline OmHub, you are subjected only to the governing laws that the system must conform in balancing between individual and state rights where Invisible Market Values according to natural laws such as Empathy and Economics operate.
